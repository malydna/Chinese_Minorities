			<h2>History
                Origin--Nomadic confederation
                The history of the Mongols can be traced back to Xiongnu and Donghu. Cohabiting with the Turks for a long time on the central Asian steppe, they became the two ancestors of the Later Mongolians (General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001).
                
                After the Donghu was defeated by Xiongnu king Modu Chanyu, it was incorporated into the Xiongnu, and its rest tribal members retreated to the Wuhuan and Xianbei mountains, which were divided into the Wuhuan and Xianbei peoples. Wu Huan declined and disappeared and Xianbei rose (Pulleyblank, 1983). During AD156-235, Xianbei was disintegrated and divided into the Murong, Tuoba and Tuoba’s branch -- the Rouran tribes continued to rule over central and northern China (General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001). Later (AD555), the rule of Tuoba collapsed and the tribe members were incorporated into ancient China. Rouran was also defeated by the Turks and divided into the north and south. The southern branch of Rouran fled to the upper reaches of the Liao River and became the ancestral source of a small number of Khitan people. The northern branch fled to the east of Yablonov Mountains and the south of outer Xing 'an Mountains (the northeast of China), and became one of the ancestors of Mengwu Shiwei, founding the Tatar confederation. ‘Mengwu’ and ‘Mongolia’ is a different translation of the same name (Simaqian and Chen, 2019; Tan, n.d., 2014; Pulleyblank, 1983; General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001).
                
                Rise--Country
                From 907 to 1125, these people (at this time they were known as the Khitans) formed a far larger and more united state, the Liao Dynasty, ruling almost all northern China. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Liao Dynasty collapsed and divided to Qara Khitai, Jurchen dynasty and other small tribals. After that, Hebulehan (the great-grandfather of Genghis Khan) united some tribes and established the Mongwu Kingdom. The regime established by his descendants in Iran, Xulewu Khanate, originally meant to be a clan and later meant to be a state (Mongolia | History, Capital, Map, Flag, Language, Population, Size, & Facts, 2007; General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001).
                
                Apex--Super empire
                In 1206, the Mongolian group led by Genghis Khan rose rapidly and unified the remaining tribes in northern China. The word Mongolia became the common name of all the tribes [11] and the Great Khan of Mongolia became the title of the Mongol national monarch. The Mongol Empire was established. In 1218, Genghis Khan incorporated the Qara Khitai after which the Khitan passed into obscurity. Genghis Khan knew that the only way to unite the warring nomads was through foreign campaigns, so they embarked on a crusade. As the Mongol empire expanded, the Mongols spread almost all over Eurasia, carrying out military operations from the Adriatic Sea to Java in Indonesia, and from Japan to Palestine (Gaza). Between 1220 and 1368, they simultaneously became the Padishahs of Persia, emperors of China, sultans of Egypt, and rulers of Russia (Bentley, 1993; General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001).
                
                Decline--Dismember and return to the beginning
                With the disintegration of the empire, the dispersed Mongol ethnic group quickly adopted and assimilated the surrounding Turkic culture, forming part of Afghanistan's Hazara, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Tartars, Turkmen, Uyghur, Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Caucasian, Iranian, etc. However, most Yuan Mongols returned to Mongolia in 1368, preserving their language and culture. Since then, until the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Mongols have been gathering in the north of China and the Mongolian grassland, and no longer expand. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Outer Mongolia became independent in the early 21st century. Since then, the Mongolians have been divided into outer Mongolians and Inner Mongolians of the People's Republic of China (General history of Mongolian nationality, 2001).
