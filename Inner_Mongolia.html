    <h1>ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ，Hohhot   </h1>
    <p>It is the capital of Inner Mongolia of the People's Republic of China, located in the south-central part of Inner Mongolia. The city borders on the southwest of Ordos to the north, neighbors Baotou City, the northeast borders Ulanchabu City, and the southeast reaches Shanxi Xin City and Shuozhou City.</p>
    <p>It is located on the southern edge of the Mongolian Plateau, at the southern foot of the Yinshan Mountains, Daqing Mountain in the north, Manhan Mountain in the southeast, and Tumochuan Plain in the southwest. The Yellow River flows through the southwest border, and the Dahei River flows from the northeast to the southwest through the urban area and into the Yellow River. The city has a total area of ​​17,186 square kilometers and a population of 3.126 million</p>
  <marquee><p>The ancient human activities in the Yinshan Mountains of Hohhot have a long history. The "Dayao Culture" discovered in the northeast of Hohhot in 1973, 500,000 years ago, occurred in the early to late Paleolithic period in the same period as the Beijingers in Zhoukoudian, Beijing.
    Before the Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period, some northern nomads, such as the Xiongnu, Linhu, and Loufan, lived as nomads in today's Hohhot area. During the Warring States Period, Zhao Wuling, the king of the State of Zhao, promoted the "Hufu riding and shooting". After defeating the two nomads, Linhu and Loufan, he built a city in the cloud in Tuoketuo County, Hohhot. The Chinese nationality of the Central Plains began to settle in Hohhao. "Zhao Great Wall" passes Daqingshan in the north of Hohhot. In 221 BC, Emperor Qin Shihuang unified China and established 36 prefectures, one of which was Yunzhong County near Hohhot. In the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Yunzhong was one of the outposts to guard against the Huns and one of the bases for expeditions to the Huns. Today's Tali Village in the Xincheng District has left the Tucheng ruins from the Western Han Dynasty. "Shengle", the capital of the early Northern Wei Dynasty, was located in the north of Shangtucheng Village in Helinger County, 40 kilometers south of Hohhot, and the west of Shengle Economic Zone. During the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, the Tang army defeated the Turks in Baidao (now the North Centipede Dam in Hohhot). In 708 (the second year of Jinglong), the Tang dynasty established three "surviving cities" in the east, middle and west in the Hetao area. The "Fengzhou" in the Liao Dynasty was also here. At the beginning of the 10th century, the Liao Kingdom set up the Tiande Army and Fengzhou here. The former site of Fengzhou is near Baita Village, about 20 kilometers southeast of Hohhot. At the beginning of the 12th century AD, Jurchen destroyed Liao and Jianjin. It is still called Fengzhou. It was a military town at that time and one of the prefectures with dense population and prosperous business. During the Yuan Dynasty, Fengzhou's economy and culture developed rapidly. The literati Liu Bingzhong said in his poem: "The middle tower of the temple is high in the clear sky, and the Pingming city is upstairs at Xiaori. The chariots and horses are less than the dust, and the whip whips obliquely across Fengzhou."After the Yuan Dynasty was overthrown by the Ming Dynasty, the Mongols retreated outside the Great Wall and established the Beiyuan regime. The Ming Dynasty successively set up more than 40 health posts in the Monan area, each under the jurisdiction of the 13th King of Sai. At that time, Hohhot was under the jurisdiction of the King of Jin and was the seat of Dongshengwei. In 1388, the Northern Yuan split into Eastern Tartar and Western Oala. At the end of the 15th century, the eastern Mongolian leader Dayan Khan unified Monan Mongolia to achieve "Zhongxing". In 1572, Aletan Khan, the grandson of Mongolian leader Dayan Khan, led the Tumote tribe to be stationed in Hohhot, and built the "Kukuhetun" city in the present Yuquan District. From then on, the Tumote tribe transitioned from nomadic pasture to settled life. . Al Tan Khan had previously entered into a vassal relationship with the Ming Dynasty, and Al Tan Khan was named the "King of Shunyi". During the Wanli period, the Ming government gave Kuku and Tunhan the name "Guihua", which meant that minorities were subordinated to one, and they were subject to the rule of the Ming court. This is the naturalized city (ie the old city).
    From the thirteenth year of Yongzheng reign (1735) to the fourth year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, a new military garrison city was built in the east of Guihua City, named "Suiyuan City" (that is, the new city). Later, the two cities of "Guihua" and "Suiyuan" were merged. It is naturalized county.
    During the Republic of China, Gui Sui City was the capital of Suiyuan Province
    The Map of Suiyuan Province in the "Comprehensive Map of China" in 1936 by the Asian New Earth Society
    In 1913, the Republic of China changed its name to Guisui County. In 1928, Suiyuan Province was established, and Guisui City was established in the urban area of ​​Guisui County as the provincial capital. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Mengjiang regime of Japan changed Guisui City to "Houhe Special City". After Japan was defeated, it was renamed to Sui City. In 1950, the People's Republic of China withdrew the county and set it back to Sui City. In 1954, Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan merged. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region moved here from Zhangjiakou City, and Hohhot City was established as the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.</p>
