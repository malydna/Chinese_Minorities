We are three master students at King's College London, working on a Cultural Web Project in group. Our website includes the history of the Chinese minorities of three northern Chinese regions (Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Manchu). 

This site is created for research purpose by Wenluo Duan, Chungfai Lam, and Wentao Huang, using Jekyll.

It is currently deployed at this address:
